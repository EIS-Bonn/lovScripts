# Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV) - Scripts

This is the [BigDataOcean Metadata Docker Repository (based on LOV)](https://github.com/EIS-Bonn/BigDataOcean-LOV). LOV provides a choice of several hundreds of such vocabularies, based on quality requirements including URI stability and availability on the Web, use of standard formats and publication best practices, quality metadata and documentation, identifiable and trustable publication body, proper versioning policy.

Scripts include:

**Aggregator** - check for vocabulary updates and update vocabulary records in case something has changed or the LOV Bot has not been able to access or parse the file.

**Elasticsearch** - set of 2 scripts for creating the index and index LOV data using the NQuads file

**Mongo2RDF** - Export the LOV data from MongoDB to RDF representation (N3 file for LOV records only and NQuads for LOV records + latest version of each vocabulary)

**Stats** - Generates summary stats for vocabulaies, tags, etc. stored in MongoDB.

**Suggest** - Access to LOV bot for getting an analysis of a URI.
